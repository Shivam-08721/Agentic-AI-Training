Security Best Practices ðŸ”’
To protect sensitive information, you can instruct Cline to ignore specific files or patterns in your .clinerules. This is particularly important for:

.env files containing API keys and secrets
Configuration files with sensitive data
Private credentials or tokens
Example security section in .clinerules:

# Security

## Sensitive Files
DO NOT read or modify:
- .env files
- **/config/secrets.* 
- **/*.pem
- Any file containing API keys, tokens, or credentials

## Security Practices
- Never commit sensitive files
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Keep credentials out of logs and output
