    "# Day 5: Financial Agent Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides the starter code to implement a financial advisory agent that builds on concepts from Days 1-4. You'll create an agent that can analyze financial queries, retrieve relevant information, and generate well-reasoned investment advice.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "- Implement a specialized financial agent using the ReAct pattern\n",
    "- Apply Chain-of-Thought reasoning to financial decision-making\n",
    "- Integrate reflection mechanisms for self-correction\n",
    "- Create a functional agent that handles the financial queries from Day 2"
