    "\n",
    "This notebook bridges the gap between rule-based agents and AI-powered agents by introducing the fundamentals of Large Language Models (LLMs). We'll cover what LLMs are, how to use them, and how they differ from the pattern-matching approach we saw in the SimpleAgent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you'll understand:\n",
    "- What LLMs are and how they differ from rule-based systems\n",
    "- How to set up and use LLM APIs\n",
    "- Basic prompting techniques\n",
    "- Key concepts: tokens, temperature, and context windows\n",
    "- How to build simple LLM-powered agents\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "- Completed the `agent_demo.ipynb` notebook\n",
    "- Basic Python knowledge\n",
    "- API keys for OpenAI or OpenRouter (we'll use OpenRouter for flexibility)"

    "## 1. From Pattern Matching to Language Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rule-Based Approach (What We've Seen)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the SimpleAgent, we used pattern matching:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if \"weather\" in user_input:\n",
    "    return self.get_weather()\n",
    "elif \"time\" in user_input:\n",
    "    return self.get_time()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:**\n",
    "- Only understands exact patterns\n",
    "- Can't handle variations or context\n",
    "- Requires explicit programming for each case\n",
    "- No real \"understanding\" of language\n",
    "\n",
    "### LLM Approach (What We're Learning)\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs understand language naturally:\n",
    "- \"What's the weather?\" ✓\n",
    "- \"How's the weather looking?\" ✓\n",
    "- \"Is it going to rain?\" ✓\n",
    "- \"Do I need an umbrella?\" ✓\n",
    "\n",
    "All these variations are understood without explicit programming!"

    "## 2. What Are Large Language Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Large Language Models (LLMs)** are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like text. Think of them as incredibly sophisticated pattern recognition systems that have \"read\" much of the internet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Trained on Text**: Learned from billions of web pages, books, and articles\n",
    "2. **Probabilistic**: Generate responses based on patterns they've learned\n",
    "3. **Contextual**: Understand meaning based on surrounding context\n",
    "4. **Generative**: Can create new, coherent text\n",
    "5. **Versatile**: Can perform many tasks without specific programming\n",
    "\n",
    "### Popular LLMs for Educational Use:\n",
    "- **Claude Haiku** (Anthropic): Fast, reliable, and helpful - our default choice\n",
    "- **DeepSeek** (DeepSeek): Excellent balance of cost and capability, strong at coding\n",
    "- **Llama 3.3** (Meta): Open-source, multilingual, 70B parameters\n",
    "- **GPT-4o-mini** (OpenAI): Efficient and reliable for general tasks\n",
    "- **Gemma** (Google): Good for resource-constrained deployments"

    "## 3.1 Understanding the LLM API Call Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we make our first API call, let's understand each component of an LLM API request:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = client.chat.completions.create(\n",
    "    model=\"anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku\",    # Which LLM to use\n",
    "    messages=[                             # The conversation history\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"role\": \"system\",              # Who is speaking\n",
    "            \"content\": \"You are helpful\"   # What they're saying\n",
    "        },\n",
    "        {\n",
    "            \"role\": \"user\",\n",
    "            \"content\": \"Hello!\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    ],\n",
    "    temperature=0.7,                       # Creativity level (0-2)\n",
    "    max_tokens=100,                        # Maximum response length\n",
    "    top_p=1.0,                            # Nucleus sampling (advanced)\n",
    "    frequency_penalty=0,                   # Reduce repetition\n",
    "    presence_penalty=0,                    # Encourage new topics\n",
    "    stream=False                          # Get response all at once\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components Explained:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **client**: The OpenAI client configured with OpenRouter's endpoint\n",
    "   - Handles authentication and API communication\n",
    "   - Routes requests to different model providers\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **model**: Specifies which LLM to use\n",
    "   - Format: `provider/model-name` (e.g., \"anthropic/claude-3.5-haiku\")\n",
    "   - Different models have different strengths, costs, and speeds\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **messages**: The conversation context as a list of message objects\n",
    "   - Each message has a `role` and `content`\n",
    "   - Maintains conversation history for context\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **temperature** (0.0 - 2.0): Controls randomness\n",
    "   - 0: Deterministic, always picks most likely word\n",
    "   - 0.7: Balanced creativity (default)\n",
    "   - 2.0: Very creative, might be incoherent\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **max_tokens**: Maximum length of the response\n",
    "   - 1 token ≈ 0.75 words\n",
    "   - Prevents runaway responses and controls costs\n",
    "   - Set based on your needs (e.g., 50 for short answers, 500 for essays)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Optional Parameters**:\n",
    "   - **top_p**: Alternative to temperature for controlling randomness\n",
    "   - **frequency_penalty** (-2.0 to 2.0): Reduces word repetition\n",
    "   - **presence_penalty** (-2.0 to 2.0): Encourages talking about new topics\n",
    "   - **stream**: If True, receive response in chunks (like ChatGPT typing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Response Object Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = {\n",
    "    \"id\": \"chatcmpl-abc123\",              # Unique identifier\n",
    "    \"object\": \"chat.completion\",           # Response type\n",

    "- **Search** the web for current information  \n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Accuracy**: LLMs can hallucinate facts or make calculation errors. Tools provide reliable, verifiable results.\n",
