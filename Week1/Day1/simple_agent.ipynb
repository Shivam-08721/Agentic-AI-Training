    "### Pattern Matching Flow\n",
    "\n",
    "The SimpleAgent follows this high-level flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing**: Convert user input to lowercase and strip whitespace\n",
    "2. **Intent Detection**: Use simple keyword matching to determine the user's intent\n",
    "3. **Pattern Extraction**: Use regular expressions to extract relevant details\n",
    "4. **Action Execution**: Call the appropriate function based on the detected intent\n",
    "5. **Response Formatting**: Format the result into a human-readable response\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Rigid Pattern Matching**: Only understands specific phrasings\n",
    "2. **No Context Memory**: Can't remember previous interactions\n",
    "3. **Limited Language Understanding**: No concept of synonyms, implications, or variations\n",
    "4. **No Learning**: Doesn't improve from interactions\n",
    "5. **Feature Isolation**: Each feature works in isolation without integration\n",
    "6. **Brittle Error Handling**: Unexpected inputs often result in unhelpful responses"

    "1. **Better Weather Feature**:\n",
    "   - Add support for future forecasts (\"weather tomorrow\")\n",

    "   - Add time-based reminders\n",
    "   - Implement persistence (save to file)\n",

    "5. **General Improvements**:\n",
    "   - Add more robust natural language understanding\n",
    "   - Implement context tracking\n",
    "   - Add a simple machine learning component for pattern recognition\n",
