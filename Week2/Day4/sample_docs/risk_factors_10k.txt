Market Competition Risks
We operate in highly competitive markets with rapidly evolving technology. Our competitors include large technology companies with significantly greater resources than us. If we fail to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

Regulatory and Compliance Risks
We are subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations. Changes in regulations, particularly in data privacy and financial services, could increase our compliance costs and limit our business operations.

Economic and Market Risks
