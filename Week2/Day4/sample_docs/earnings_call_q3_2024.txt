Good morning, and thank you for joining our Q3 2024 earnings call. I'm pleased to report strong financial performance this quarter.

Revenue for Q3 2024 reached $2.4 billion, representing a 15% increase year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong performance in our cloud services division, which saw 28% growth, and our traditional software licensing business, which remained stable at $800 million.

Operating margins improved to 22%, up from 19% in the same quarter last year. This improvement reflects our continued focus on operational efficiency and cost management initiatives implemented throughout 2024.

Cash flow from operations was $450 million, providing us with strong liquidity to invest in growth initiatives. We ended the quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents.

Looking ahead to Q4, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.5 to $2.6 billion, with continued strength in cloud services offsetting seasonal softness in other segments.

We remain confident in our long-term strategy and our ability to deliver sustainable growth and value to shareholders.
