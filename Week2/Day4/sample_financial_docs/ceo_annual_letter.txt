LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS
TechCorp Inc. - 2024 Annual Report

Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As I reflect on 2024, I am proud of what we accomplished together and excited about the opportunities ahead. This year marked a pivotal moment in TechCorp's transformation from a traditional software company to a cloud-first, AI-enabled platform that empowers businesses to thrive in the digital economy.

Our financial results tell a compelling story of growth, profitability, and operational excellence. We delivered record revenue of $9.3 billion, representing 15% growth year-over-year, while expanding operating margins to 22% and generating over $1.5 billion in free cash flow. These results reflect not just strong execution, but the fundamental strength of our business model and the value we create for customers.

STRATEGIC TRANSFORMATION

The cloud transformation that we began five years ago has reached an inflection point. Cloud services now represent 47% of our total revenue, growing 28% year-over-year to $4.4 billion. This shift represents more than just a technology migration; it's a fundamental reimagining of how we serve customers and create value.

Our cloud-first approach delivers multiple benefits:
- Predictable, recurring revenue streams that provide better visibility and planning
- Stronger customer relationships through continuous value delivery and innovation
- Operational leverage that drives margin expansion as we scale
- Global reach and accessibility that opens new markets and customer segments
- Real-time insights and analytics that help customers optimize their operations

The transition has not been without challenges. Moving from perpetual license sales to subscription models required significant changes to our sales organization, compensation structures, and customer success operations. We invested heavily in new capabilities, retrained thousands of employees, and rebuilt core systems to support a cloud-centric operating model.

These investments are now paying dividends. Our Net Revenue Retention rate of 118% demonstrates that customers are not just staying with us—they're expanding their usage as they realize value from our platforms. Customer satisfaction scores have reached all-time highs, and our Net Promoter Score improved 400 basis points during 2024.

ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND INNOVATION

Artificial intelligence represents the next frontier of business transformation, and we are positioned to be a leader in helping enterprises harness its power responsibly and effectively. Unlike some technology companies that view AI as a replacement for human judgment, we see it as an amplifier of human capability and business intelligence.

Our AI strategy focuses on three core principles:

Practical Applications: We develop AI capabilities that solve real business problems rather than pursuing technology for its own sake. Our AI-powered features launched in 2024 automate routine tasks, surface insights from complex data, and help users make better decisions faster.

Security and Trust: Enterprise customers require AI solutions that meet the highest standards for security, privacy, and regulatory compliance. Our AI capabilities are built with enterprise-grade security from the ground up, with clear data governance and audit trails.

Human-Centered Design: The most effective AI solutions enhance human capabilities rather than replacing them. Our interfaces are designed to keep humans in control while providing powerful automation and insights.

The early results are encouraging. AI-enabled features show 40% higher engagement rates and are associated with 15% higher customer lifetime value. More importantly, customers report significant productivity improvements and operational efficiencies that translate directly to their bottom line.

CYBERSECURITY AND TRUST

In an increasingly connected world, cybersecurity is not just a feature—it's fundamental to everything we do. The threat landscape continues to evolve, with more sophisticated attacks targeting the software supply chain, cloud infrastructure, and remote work environments.

We made significant investments in cybersecurity during 2024, both to protect our own operations and to help customers defend against emerging threats. Our Security Operations Center monitors threats 24/7 across our global infrastructure, and we conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to identify and address vulnerabilities.

Our cybersecurity solutions business grew 35% in 2024, now representing 15% of total revenue. This growth reflects not just market demand, but the trust that customers place in our ability to protect their most valuable assets. We're particularly proud that zero customer data breaches occurred on our platforms during 2024, a testament to the effectiveness of our security investments.

Looking ahead, we're expanding our cybersecurity offerings to address emerging threats around AI systems, IoT devices, and quantum computing. The convergence of AI and cybersecurity presents both opportunities and challenges that will shape our industry for years to come.

GLOBAL EXPANSION AND MARKET OPPORTUNITY

Our international expansion continued to accelerate in 2024, with revenue from markets outside North America growing 22% to represent 35% of total revenue. This growth was driven by strong performance in Europe, where our GDPR compliance capabilities and data sovereignty options resonated with enterprise customers.

Asia-Pacific emerged as a particularly promising region, with revenue growing 45% as digital transformation initiatives accelerated across the region. Our new offices in Singapore and Sydney provide local presence and support for customers in key markets, while our partnerships with regional system integrators expand our reach into new verticals and customer segments.

The global opportunity for enterprise software remains enormous. Digital transformation is still in its early stages in many industries and regions. Small and medium-sized businesses represent a largely untapped market for cloud-based enterprise solutions. Emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and edge computing are creating new categories of software needs.

We estimate our total addressable market at over $500 billion globally, with less than 1% market share today. This provides ample runway for growth as we continue to expand our product portfolio, geographic presence, and customer segments.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

Building a sustainable business means more than financial performance—it requires responsibility to all stakeholders, including employees, customers, communities, and the environment. Our Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) initiatives are integrated into our business strategy and operations.

Environmental Impact: We achieved carbon neutrality across our operations in 2024, two years ahead of our original target. Our cloud infrastructure optimization initiatives reduced energy consumption by 25% while improving performance. We're committed to net-zero emissions by 2030 and are investing in renewable energy and carbon removal technologies.

Social Impact: Technology should create opportunities for everyone, not just the privileged few. Our digital inclusion initiatives provided free technology training to over 100,000 individuals from underrepresented communities. We partnered with educational institutions to create pathways into technology careers and supported workforce development programs in underserved areas.

Diversity and Inclusion: Our workforce becomes stronger when it reflects the diversity of our customers and communities. Women now represent 38% of our workforce and 45% of our leadership team, while underrepresented minorities represent 32% of our US workforce. These gains reflect intentional efforts to create an inclusive culture where everyone can contribute their best work.

Governance: We maintain the highest standards of corporate governance, with independent board oversight, transparent reporting, and ethical business practices. Our board includes diverse perspectives and deep expertise in technology, cybersecurity, international markets, and corporate strategy.

CAPITAL ALLOCATION AND SHAREHOLDER RETURNS

Our strong cash generation provides flexibility to invest in growth while returning capital to shareholders. During 2024, we invested $800 million in research and development, $400 million in sales and marketing expansion, and $300 million in strategic acquisitions that enhanced our AI and cybersecurity capabilities.

We returned $600 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, representing approximately 40% of free cash flow. Our dividend increased 15% during the year, marking the eighth consecutive year of dividend growth. Share repurchases were conducted opportunistically to offset dilution and take advantage of market volatility.

Looking ahead, we expect to maintain a balanced approach to capital allocation, with approximately 50-60% of free cash flow reinvested in the business and 40-50% returned to shareholders. This framework provides flexibility to pursue strategic opportunities while ensuring consistent returns to shareholders.

ORGANIZATIONAL CAPABILITIES

Our transformation would not be possible without the dedication and expertise of our 42,000 employees worldwide. We continue to invest in developing our people and building the capabilities needed for future success.

Talent Development: We launched TechCorp University in 2024, providing world-class training and development opportunities for all employees. Over 85% of employees participated in at least 40 hours of professional development during the year. Our internal mobility rate reached 25%, demonstrating strong career growth opportunities.

Culture and Values: Our culture emphasizes customer obsession, innovation, integrity, and collaboration. Employee engagement scores improved 12% during 2024, while voluntary turnover remained below industry averages despite a competitive talent market.

Future Skills: We're actively developing capabilities in AI, cybersecurity, cloud architecture, and data science through hiring, training, and strategic partnerships with universities. Our apprenticeship programs are creating new pathways into technology careers while building the skills we need for growth.

LOOKING AHEAD

As we enter 2025, I'm optimistic about our prospects and the opportunities ahead. The fundamental drivers of our business—digital transformation, cloud adoption, AI advancement, and cybersecurity needs—continue to strengthen. Our competitive position has never been better, and our financial foundation provides the flexibility to invest in future growth.

We have ambitious goals for the next phase of our journey:
- Achieve $15 billion in annual revenue by 2027, with cloud services representing 70% of the total
- Expand operating margins to 25-27% through operational leverage and efficiency gains
- Launch next-generation AI platform that sets new standards for enterprise intelligence
- Establish leadership position in emerging markets across Asia-Pacific and Latin America
- Maintain industry-leading customer satisfaction and retention metrics

None of this would be possible without the trust and support of our shareholders, customers, partners, and employees. Thank you for being part of our journey and for your continued confidence in our ability to create long-term value.

The future of business is digital, intelligent, and secure. TechCorp is building the platform that will power that future.

Sincerely,

Sarah Johnson
